# Fork

This is a fork of [Smyck Color Scheme] that takes `smyck.vim` and organizes it as a vim package. Everything else is deleted.

## Installation

Inside `.vim/`:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jvf/Smyck-Color-Scheme.git pack/<you-plugin-dir>/start/
```

Add the following to your `vimrc`:

```vim
colorscheme smyck
```

# Smyck Color Scheme

This is a color scheme suitable for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Vim, gVim,
MacVim, Textmate and Sublime Text 2.

The colors are carefully chosen and the contrasts are tuned so that it
should not hurt the eyes even after a whole day of working.

# Disclaimer

Currently its still a moving target but if you want to help, please try
it out and report screenshots of weird looking things.

There is also an Eclipse adoption of this theme available at
[https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme](https://github.com/m42i/Smyck-Color-Scheme).

Once the final color map is done this repository will include a proper
documentation.
